Analyze the following text and determine if it contains shopping/product items that a user wants to add to a shopping list.

Consider these criteria:
- Contains one OR multiple items (food, household goods, groceries, etc.)
- Multiple items might be separated by commas, newlines, or dashes
- Items might include quantities (2kg, 1L, 3 pieces, etc.)
- Could be in different languages (English, Russian, Ukrainian)
- Single clear shopping items should be treated as valid (e.g., "порошок", "молоко", "bread")
- Common household/grocery products should have high confidence even when single
- Avoid false positives for random words, names, or non-shopping related text

  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
