## Ambiguous Items and Context-Based Mappings:

### High Ambiguity Cases (confidence < 0.8):
These items require contextual inference and should have lower confidence scores:

- "raw" → likely "milk" (dairy context)
- "green" → likely "lettuce" or "herbs" (produce context)  
- "white" → could be "rice", "bread", "milk" (context dependent)
- "red" → likely "tomatoes", "apples", or "meat" (context dependent)
- "big" → needs additional context
- "small" → needs additional context
- "fresh" → modifier, extract the actual item

### Common Abbreviations:
- "choc" → "chocolate"
- "veggies" → "vegetables" 
- "fruits" → "mixed fruits"
- "meat" → "beef" (default assumption)
- "fish" → "fish" (seafood category)

### Context Clues:
When items are ambiguous, use these strategies:
1. Look for quantity units (2L suggests liquid like milk)
2. Consider common shopping patterns
3. Use lower confidence scores (0.6-0.8) for ambiguous items
4. Default to most common interpretation

### Multi-word Items:
- "olive oil" → {"standardized_name": "olive oil", "category": "pantry", "subcategory": "oil"}
- "ice cream" → {"standardized_name": "ice cream", "category": "frozen", "subcategory": "dessert"}
- "toilet paper" → {"standardized_name": "toilet paper", "category": "household", "subcategory": "paper_products"}
- "washing powder" → {"standardized_name": "washing powder", "category": "household", "subcategory": "laundry"}
