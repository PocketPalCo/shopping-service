ðŸ¤” <b>Possible Shopping List Detected</b>

I noticed you might be trying to add items to a shopping list, but I'm not completely sure.

If you want to add items to a list:
â€¢ Use /lists to manage your shopping lists manually
â€¢ Try writing items more clearly (e.g., "milk, bread, eggs")
â€¢ Use /createlist to create a new shopping list

If this wasn't a shopping list, you can ignore this message! ðŸ˜Š
