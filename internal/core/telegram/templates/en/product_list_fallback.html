🛒 <b>Shopping List Detected!</b>

I can see you've shared what looks like a shopping list, but to use this feature you need to be part of a family.

<b>What you can do:</b>
• Use /families to create or join a family
• Use /help to see all available commands
• Use /lists to manage your personal lists

Once you're in a family, just send me your shopping list and I'll help you organize it! 📝
